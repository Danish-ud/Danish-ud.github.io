      <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
      <ul class="tech-list">
        <li>SQL - Utilized mysql server to handle Data Cleaning and for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).</li>
        <li>Power Bi -For building Dashboards and Data Visulization.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>  
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
      <li>Performed initial data cleaning using MySQL Workbench, focusing on identifying and resolving duplicate and null values across key tables.</li>
      <li>Addressed missing data systematically by applying appropriate treatments such as imputation, exclusion, or flagging, based on business logic and context.</li>
      <li>Removed irrelevant or redundant rows that did not contribute to meaningful analysis (e.g., incomplete transactions, test records).</li>
      <li>Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on each and every table using primary key and with the help of joins.</li>
     <li>Below is the Sql file with all the queries performed.</li>
</div> 
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Data Visualisations</h2>
      <p>Power bi was used to represent Dashoards that were generated by Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA).</p>
      <li>Found the top selling products overall.</li>
      <li>Identified trnds on sales over time.</li>
      <li>Found the top customers by total orders.</li>
      <h4>Data Connection:</h4>
      <img src="Data Connection.png" alt="Chart Placeholder" style="width:100%; border-radius:10px; margin-top:15px;">
      <h3>Sales Analysis</h3>
      <img src="Sales Analysis.png" alt="Chart Placeholder" style="width:100%; border-radius:10px; margin-top:15px;">
      <li>The chart highlights the top 5 customers by total order volume. Notably, Save-a-Lot Markets, Ernst Handel, and Quick-Stop emerge as the top three clients, contributing significantly to overall sales.</li>
      <li>The revenue by product category visualization shows that Beverages, Dairy Products, and Meat/Poultry are the highest-performing categories in terms of revenue generation. In contrast, Grains/Cereals contribute the least, indicating a potential area for promotional or inventory reevaluation.</li>
      <li>From a geographical perspective, the majority of orders originate from the USA and Germany, whereas countries like Sweden, Ireland, and Canada have minimal engagement. This suggests an opportunity to implement more targeted marketing and outreach strategies in underperforming regions to expand the customer base.</li>
      <li>The trend analysis indicates a steady increase in order volume between 2013 and 2015, reflecting positive business growth. This momentum could be leveraged to scale operations, enhance logistics, and strengthen supplier relationships.</li>
      <h4>Employees Performance</h4>
      <img src="Employees Performance.png"style="width:100%; border-radius:10px; margin-top:10px;">

      <li>The Employee Performance analysis highlights that Margaret, Janet, and Nancy are the most active in terms of customer engagement and order volume. These employees are contributing significantly to overall sales, suggesting strong client relationship skills and operational efficiency.</li>
      <li>In contrast, Michael, Anna, and Steven appear to have lower interaction levels and fewer processed orders, indicating potential underperformance or areas that may benefit from additional training or support.</li>
      <li>Revenue breakdown by employee further supports this trend â€” Margaret, Janet, and Nancy generate the highest total revenue, whereas Steven and Michael rank at the bottom. This data can be used to recognize top performers and realign responsibilities or incentives accordingly</li>
